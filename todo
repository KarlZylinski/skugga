- make temp allocator nicer
    figure out a way to get rid of the array of allocations
    add stack allocation for small allocations (4kb?)

- refactor renderer
    maybe make renderer_direct3d into it's own compilation unit so it's totally separate? make a c renderer interface with function ptrs that the direct3d renderer has to comply with. make d3d renderer only return renderer_handles. could also throw all windows stuff into it's own compilation unit.
    add renderer world to which stuff is added and removed, everything in it is rendered

- research lightmap uv unwrapping
